# AI-Powered Resume Screening and Candidate Matching System
One of my most exciting projects is the AI-powered Resume Screening and Candidate Matching System, designed to automate the recruitment process and enhance hiring decisions. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, the system analyzes resumes, matches candidates to job descriptions, and ranks them based on their skills, experience, and qualificationsâ€”helping HR teams and recruiters make more data-driven decisions.I built the system using Flask for the backend and Next.js for the frontend, with features like resume parsing, skill matching, AI-powered ranking, and job description matching. A key feature is the NLP model that extracts key attributes from resumes, such as skills, qualifications, and experiences, and then compares them with job descriptions to identify the most suitable candidates. The system uses machine learning models to rank candidates based on how well their profiles align with job requirements, enabling better recommendations for hiring decisions.What excites me most about this project is its potential to reduce manual effort and bias in the recruitment process. By automating resume screening and matching candidates efficiently, the system saves valuable time for HR teams while also ensuring a more objective and fair selection process. It was rewarding to see AI make a significant impact on improving hiring efficiency and the overall experience for both recruiters and candidates. This project reinforced my passion for applying AI to real-world business challenges and creating scalable, intelligent solutions.
